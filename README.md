=========

Finds groups in networks (e.g., food webs) using Bayesian stochastic block models and Metropolis-coupled Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MC3).

Includes the Bayesan group model used in Baskerville et al. 2011 (PLOS Computational Biology):

http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002321

which is based on the maximum-likelihood version in Allesina and Pascual 2009 (Ecology Letters):

Also includes directed and undirected Bayesian implementations of the degree-corrected stochastic block model of Karrer 2011 (Physical Review E):
